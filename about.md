<p> Hey, I'm Lucy! I am a bioinformatics Master's student at Temple University. I obtained my Bachelor's of Science degree in Biology from Temple University in December 2023. During my undergraduate career I also completed two certificate programs -- one in computer programming and another in genomic medicine. At Temple I was also a member of the Honors program and Dean's List for multiple semesters, as well as a student at Temple Rome in Summer 2021. My research experience is in bioinformatics with Temple's Institute for Computational Molecular Science under the advisement of Dr. Vincenzo Carnevale where I have been assisting a project relating to the effect of epistasis on phylogenetic tree shape. </p>
